Solutions are written in python 3. This is for educational purposes only. The solutions are not perfect or optimized and can always be improved. This repository serves as a personal storage of my solutions and I will not be accepting PRs or Issues on this project as a result.

DO NOT try to contact me asking for the any missing solutions. If there is a missing solution in this repository, it means I could not solve the problem for the day.
